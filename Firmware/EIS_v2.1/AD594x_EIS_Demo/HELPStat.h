    07/01/2024: Added transmission of phase and magnitude

    06/19/2024: Started adjusting HELPStat::AD5940_DFTMeasure() to transmit index (of measurement), 
    frequency (of current sample), Zreal, and Zim.

    06/13/2024: Shannon Riegle here. Implemented BLE communication to allow user to reconfigure different
    settings w/o needing to reprogram the HELPStat PCB each time. Also reorganized data-logging to have
    most recent logs on top. Figured this would be easier for future developers to see what the most recent
    changes to the library were.

    Also had the Levenberg-Marquardt fitting algorithm moved into this library. This is dependent on another
    C++ library called Eigen. I modified Bolder Flight System's Eigen port to include the unsupported features
    seen on the computer version, namely nonlinear solving. More documentation on that can be found at:
    https://github.com/LinnesLab/Eigen-Port
    
    05/14/2024: Renamed from TestLibImp to HELPStat for consistency with published paper.

    03/2024: Added current noise function for automatically running measurements for open-circuit noise.
    
    02/16/2024: Refactored configuration of HSTIA to be an input instead of hard-coding. 
    Gain size needs to be calculated in .ino file rather than the library. Run into bugs otherwise. 
    Seems to work reliably with dummy values. Now to test with a frequency sweep and actual EIS. 
    Should now be easier to alter gains for each measurment.
    
    02/13/2024: Added a delay input to runSweep to allow for 
    equilibration if needed. Doing it here when Sleep Mode is disabled
    just in case device goes to sleep mode in between. 
    
    02/12/2024: Made RCAL an input to TDD - better for long term. 
    Changed constDelay to 1000 instead of 3000 and the delay function
    for frequencies <= 5 Hz to do two full cycles + 2 seconds. I like this better because
    it's shorter and has more rational in letting even slower frequencies wait
    for at least two cycles without compromising the higher frequencies.

    02/11/2024: Reverted to just delaying the initial measurement rather than
    the method described in 02/10/2024. Also added settling delay func to the waveform
    generator, but honestly think that the biggest indicator of accuracy 
    is currently the RTIA. Getting some high imaginary value noise at the last measurement.
    Not sure why. Could be due to delay?

    02/10/2024: Isolated bias by turning everything but the WG on. That way
    bias is applied but no sine wave is active yet. Will see if this affects results for RC case. 
    Also want to experiment with Gain and Offset Calibration on WG.
    
    02/08/2024: Need to figure out how to isolate bias. Maybe I don't turn on WG
    until a set delay time passes?
    
    02/07/2024: Changed 500 ms to 1s but reverted back because there wasn't really a difference.
    
    02/06/2024: Moved settlingDelay() to after DFT convert starts. Added an empirical delay
    of 500 ms to when WG starts instead. Getting more consistent results this way, I think. 
    Getting an initial negative value for Rimaginary but it's low so likely alright.
    
    01/08/2024: Bias works, verified with DMM. Scope is giving mixed results, however.
    
    11/30/2023:
    Tried with the LPDAC and bias but the oscilloscope gave funky results and clipped signals.
    Removed it from the impedance codes and will test using a separate config and waveform function.
    I want to see if I can't find consistent settings that could hopefully lead to a variable bias 
    and a better waveform output because if it's clipping like the scope showed, could be an area
    of inconsistency. Will test with KFeCN for now with the current bias (1.1V)
    and see what results look like. 

    11/06/2023:
    Looks like the issue was primarily the HSTIA (go figure) values. Set them 
    appropriately and getting decent data. Problem is that high frequency 
    around 100kHz to about 20kHz is relatively noisy, and low frequency (< 0.5 Hz) is too. 

    Will try increasing the settling time for the low frequency runs < 0.5 Hz to double the period
    + a constant. Unsure of what to do for the high frequency noise. I want to try 
    adding a delay between cycles because I think it may switch too fast after calibration? 
    Is that a thing? 
    
    But overall, getting decent enough data with the sweep as it is, and 
    about a few minutes faster than the normal method. This also gives me more control about 
    what to do with the data afterwards. Can probably start testing with the impedance board like this
    since I'll keep optimizing it anyways. Will be a nice benchmark to compare with the 
    Impedance.c method that utilizes the sequencer. 

    11/05/2023: 
    Added sweep functionality and also implemented repeating cycles in the code. 
    Just need to figure out how to best add a delay for settling time without it taking 
    forever. 

    I think modern potentiostats do this by having it dependent on frequency, and 
    so I'll probably do 2/freq + a constant wait time so that I'm waiting for at least
    two periods and see if that works. Also probably need to make it more robust 
    by adding a configuration and DFT struct to enable user inputs. 

    11/05/2023:
    2 / freq + const isn't working. Will add a check frequency function
    to see if I can at least get high frequencies working. I'm not sure what
    is a good enough range to wait for the settling time.

    11/03/2023: 
    Removed sequencer functionality. Just need to add sweep and settling times.

    09/21/2023:
    Functions utilized are based on Analog Devices examples. 
    Impedance.h and Impedance.c were used to help develop our own version
    of impedance measurements and serve as a reference.
    
    Structure for interfacing with AD5941 is based on existing FreiStat port
    but extended for the ESP32.

    This library primarily exists to validate the impedance measurement
    functionality of the AD5941 and serve as a benchmark for comparison
    when creating my own library.

    The current state uses the sequencer but the goal is to ultimately 
    use it without the Sequencer to have better control in terms of signal / 
    measurement delay. At least I think using it without it is better.

    Big change - Interrupt pin is intialized to INPUT_PULLUP. I think 
    this may have been a big factor in defining an initial state for falling.
    Or not. We'll see.
